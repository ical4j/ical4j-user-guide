# iCal4j Integration - XMPP

Instant Messaging protocols such as XMPP provide an opportunity for more interactive sharing of iCalendar data.

The use of chat as an alternative user interface (UI) is growing in popularity, with Chatbots and ChatOps becoming
more popular.

With XMPP integration, new opportunities arise for querying, notifications and coordinating for calendaring
and scheduling applications.
