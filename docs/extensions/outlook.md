# iCal4j Extensions - Microsoft Outlook

Microsoft Outlook defines some additional iCalendar properties that are used internally to manage additional
calendar features.

Whilst these properties comply with the extended property naming convention (prefixed with `X-`),
because Outlook is such a pervasive Calendar User Agent (CUA), it seems convenient to define them here.
