# iCal4j Extensions - Link: Alternate

An Alternate link property provides the location of an alternate representation of the enclosing component. This
could be interpreted as a duplication of the `URL` property, however `LINK` property allows more freedom to
specify multiple representations of a component.

## Examples

    LINK;LINKREL="alternate";VALUE=URI:https://example.com/tasks/01234567-abcd1234.html
